Taking Screenshots of the Virtual Machine (VM)
==============================================

It is often necessary to take screenshots of the forensic virtual machine (forensicVM) for documentation, analysis, or reporting purposes. There are two primary ways to capture a screenshot, depending on your location within the system interface:

1) Capture Screenshot in the Main Autopsy Plugin Interface
----------------------------------------------------------

To take a screenshot of the forensicVM from the main Autopsy plugin interface, follow these steps:

   a) Navigate to the desired screen within the forensicVM.

   b) Locate the screenshot icon or use the appropriate key command.

   c) Save the screenshot to your desired location.

Capturing a screenshot from the web screen interface is similarly straightforward:

   a) Navigate to the web interface where the forensicVM is displayed.

   b) Locate the screenshot icon or use the appropriate key command within the web interface.

   c) Save the screenshot to your desired location.
