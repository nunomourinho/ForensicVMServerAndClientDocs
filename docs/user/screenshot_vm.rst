Taking Screenshots of the Virtual Machine (VM)
==============================================

It is often necessary to take screenshots of the forensic virtual machine (forensicVM) for documentation, analysis, or reporting purposes. There are two primary ways to capture a screenshot, depending on your location within the system interface:

1) Capture Screenshot in the Main Autopsy Plugin Interface
----------------------------------------------------------

To take a screenshot of the forensicVM from the main Autopsy plugin interface, please press the Screenshot button on the screenshot panel:
